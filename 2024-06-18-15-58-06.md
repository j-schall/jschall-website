**Update Recall Feature:** <br>
Microsoft's new feature Recall within the Copilot+ Update for Win11 is since a <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/06/07/update-on-the-recall-preview-feature-for-copilot-pcs/"blog entry of Microsoft on the 13th of June, only a Insider Windows feature. This means in a normal Windows Installation, the Feature is until an unkown Date, not available.
